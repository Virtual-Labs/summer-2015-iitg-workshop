#+title: Worklog for <Sumit Dahiya>
* [2015-05-21 Thu] :: Got a brief introduction of Github and all levels (level 0 to level 6) from Mr. Thirumal.
* [2015-05-22 Fri] :: With the coordination of Apoorva and Ambika, got to learn some commands about Github and also got an overview of all levels (level 0 to level 6). Repositories of all 5 labs are created. One lab is structured and also pushed to level 3 in the local machine. We're not able to push this lab on Github as the push command is not working due to some technical problems. One lab is using LabView, which needs to be converted to Sandhi.
