#+title: Worklog for <Sumit Dahiya>
* [2015-05-21 Thu] :: Got a brief introduction of Github and all levels (level 0 to level 6) from Mr. Thirumal.
* [2015-05-22 Fri] :: With the coordination of Apruv and Ambika, got to learn some commands about Github and also got an overview of all levels (level 0 to level 6). Repositories of all 5 labs are created. One lab is structured and also pushed to level 3 in the local machine. We're not able to push this lab on Github as the push command is not working due to some technical problems. One lab is using LabView, which needs to be converted to Sandhi.
* [2015-05-25 Mon] :: With the coordination of Apruv and Ambika, pushed virtual-smart-structures-and-dynamics laboratory to Level 3 and trying to put it on Level 5 on Github. Three labs are also pushed to level 3. I want atmost two and atleast one lab to be at level 6 upto [2015-05-27 Wed].
* [2015-05-26 Tue] :: With the help of Apruv, Ambika and Madhavi, Two labs are moved to level 6 (that are virtual-smart-structures-and-dynamics-laboratory-iitd and queueing-networks-modelling-lab-iitd). Request for hosting these two labs at Amazon is also sent to Engineers forum on https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/. I'm planning to host one more lab to level 6 tomorrow.
