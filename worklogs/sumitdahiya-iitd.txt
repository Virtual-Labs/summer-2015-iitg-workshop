#+title: Worklog for <Sumit Dahiya>
* [2015-05-21 Thu] :: Got a brief introduction of Github and all levels (level 0 to level 6) from Mr. Thirumal.
* [2015-05-22 Fri] :: With the coordination of Apurv and Ambika, got to learn some commands about Github and also got an overview of all levels (level 0 to level 6). Repositories of all 5 labs are created. One lab is structured and also pushed to level 3 in the local machine. We're not able to push this lab on Github as the push command is not working due to some technical problems. One lab is using LabView, which needs to be converted to Sandhi.
* [2015-05-25 Mon] :: With the coordination of Apurv and Ambika, pushed virtual-smart-structures-and-dynamics laboratory to Level 3 and trying to put it on Level 5 on Github. I want atmost two and atleast one lab to be at level 6 upto [2015-05-27 Wed].
* [2015-05-26 Tue] :: With the coordination of Apurv, Ambika and Madhavi, pushed virtual-smart-structures-and-dynamics-laboratory-iitd and queueing-networks-modelling-lab-iitd to Level 6 and sent the request for hosting on engineers forum.
* [2015-05-27 Wed] :: Trying to run bioreactor-modelling-and-simulation-laboratory-iitd manually. Currently, our two labs are at level 6 and three labs are at level 2.
* [2015-05-28 Thu] :: With the coordination of IIT Bombay team, Installed Sandhi on the system.
* [2015-05-29 Fri] :: Learnt following things from IIT Bombay team: 1. Creating blocks in Sandhi 2. Adding funtionality to these blocks. 3. Adding Source and Sink to these blocks.
* [2015-06-01 Mon] :: Revising Sandhi programs. Posted an issue (with Help Wanted label) on Engineers Forum, about problem in hosting power-electronics-and-electric-drives-laboratory-iitd as the lab uses Windows Server 2008 and IIS6. 
* [2015-06-02 Tue] :: In the source code of the virtual-smart-structures-and-dynamics-lab, some special characters(looking like white spaces) were present. Due to the them, after deploying, some question marks ("?") were appearing on the user interface of the lab. Removed these special characters from the code and then again sent the request to engineers forum to host the lab on cloud. The lab is again hosted on the cloud. Now our two labs (virtual-smart-structures-and-dynamics-laboratory-iitd and queueing-networks-modelling-lab-iitd) are at level 6 and also hosted on the cloud. 
* [2015-06-03 Wed] :: Understanding an experiment of engineering-electro-magnetics-laboratory-iitd, which is in lab view, which is in lab view.
* [2015-06-04 Thu] :: Planning to push engineering-electro-magnetics-laboratory-iitd to level 6. 
* [2015-06-05 Fri] :: With the coordination of Ambika and Sripathi, trying to install ADS on my laptop.
* [2015-06-08 Mon] :: With the coordination of Yogesh and Ambika, uninstalled previous ubuntu because it was wubi and we are not getting enough space to install centos in the virtual box. So, again installed ubuntu from a bootable pen drive.
